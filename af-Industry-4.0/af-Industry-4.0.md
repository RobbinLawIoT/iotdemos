- Operational Technology (OT) - is the use of hardware and software to monitor and control physical processes, devices, and infrastructure. OT systems are autonomous, isolated, self-contained, and run on proprietary software. OT systems do not run on regular operating systems, often lack traditional security tools, and are usually programmed differently from conventional computers.
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS) - are one of the most prominent forms of OT.
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) - IEC 61131-3 PLC Programming Languages.
- Information Technology (IT) Systems - is the development, management, and application of computer equipment, networks, software, and systems. IT systems are connected, lack autonomy, and typically run on popular operating systems like iOS and Windows. IT cybersecurity protects common devices like desktop and laptop computers, keyboards, printers, and smartphones.
